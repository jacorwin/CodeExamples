# Jason A. Corwin, PhD, MS
## Senior Principal Data Scientist - Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my coding portfolio! \
Here you will find a collection of example projects and contributions. These are just brief examples of the breadth of coding that I have done in the past. Please see my resume/cv in the root of this repository or feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

## About Me

I am a highly experienced data scientist with a focus on statistics, machine learning, and predictive analytics using a variety of biological dataset. Throughout my academic and industry career, I have worked on a variety complex projects to help elucidate biological interactions at the molecular, cellular, whole organism, and population levels. I have a specific interest in quantative genetics and epidemology of diseases.

There's never been a data set I didn't like!

## Example Projects

### PostgreSQL/Snowflake

Exploring complex datasets in large scale databases is essential for modern companies. In my previous roles, I have developed, maintained, and queried several PostgreSQL and Snowflake databases as part of a company's data warehouse. For this project folder, I have included examples of specific SQL queries using Case Studies from the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/). They can be found in the SQL subdirectory within this repository.
